signed conversion

    field width:
        - A converted value which its characters length is less than its field width value must be padded with spaces on the left.
        - A converted value which its characters length is equal to its field width value must not be modified.
        - A converted value which its characters length is less than its field width value must no be modified.
    - flag:
        - The - flag must suffix the spaces into a signed conversion which its field width is greater than the decimal representation of the parameter.
    0 flag:
        - The 0 flag must prefix zeros into a signed conversion which its field width is greater than the decimal representation of the parameter.
        - The zero flag must not modify a signed conversion that also specifies the - flag.
        - The zero flag must not modify a signed conversion that also specifies the . flag.
    space flag:
        - The space flag must prefix a space into a signed conversion of a parameter with positive value.
        - The space flag must prefix a space into a signed conversion of a parameter with zero value.
        - The space flag must prefix a space into a signed conversion resulted in no characters.
        - The space flag must not modify a signed conversion of a parameter with negative value.
        - The space flag must not modify a signed conversion that also specifies the + flag.
    + flag:
        - The + flag must prefix a plus sign into a signed conversion of a parameter with positive value.
        - The + flag must prefix a plus sign into a signed conversion of a parameter with zero value.
        - The + flag must not modify a signed conversion of a parameter with negative value.
    . flag:
        - A . flag expands a decimal representation with leading zeros if its length is less than the precision value.
        - A . flag takes no effect over a decimal representation which its length is equal to the precision value.
        - A . flag takes no effect over a decimal representation which its length is greater than the precision value.
        - A . specified conversion with both precision and int parameter value as zero writes no character.
        - If the conversion has a . flag but no precision value specified, the precision is taken as zero. // Teste para conversão de str para t_convspec
        - A negative precision argument is taken as if the precision was omitted (and therefore its zero). // Teste para conversão de str para t_convspec

        - A . flag takes no effect over a decimal representation which its length is equal to the precision value.
        - A . flag takes no effect over a decimal representation which its length is greater than the precision value.
        - A . specified conversion with both precision and int parameter value as zero writes no character.
    # flag:
        - A # flag must prefix a 0x into an unsigned conversion with specifier 'x'
        - A # flag must prefix a 0X into an unsigned conversion with specifier 'X'

ToDo:
    - Renomear "dot" para "period", seguindo a documentação oficial.
    - Renomear "width_min" para "field_width"
